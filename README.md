Retail Sales Case Study
Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset provided by a leading retail giant. The dataset contains information on customer demographics, purchase behavior, and responses to various marketing campaigns. The goal is to understand what kind of customers respond to different campaigns and to generate insights that can help improve future marketing strategies.

Data Files
The dataset is divided into three files:

Demographics Data: Customer demographics including education, marital status, income, and household composition.
Behavior Data: Purchase behavior details such as amounts spent on various product categories and purchase recency.
Campaign Data: Customer responses to multiple marketing campaigns.

Key Tasks & Insights
1. Data Quality and Cleaning:

Consolidated data from multiple sources.
Performed univariate analysis to identify missing values and outliers.
Cleaned the dataset to ensure high-quality data for analysis.

2. Business Analysis and Hypothesis Testing:

Hypothesis Testing: Explored the relationship between spending patterns and campaign response rates.
Funnel Analysis: Analyzed customer journey through different marketing campaigns.
Income Impact: Investigated how income levels influenced spending on specific product categories like Wine, Meat, Gold, and Fish.

Customer Profiling: Created profiles of customers who responded to campaigns versus those who did not.


Tools Used
